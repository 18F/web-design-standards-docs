  Let’s transform the way we design and deliver digital government with and for the people.

  Many of the ideas in this report are big-picture thinking, requiring time, collaboration, and strategies to come to fruition. But right now, you can begin by understanding the value and benefits of using the design system to deliver better digital services.

  Use the conversation starters throughout the report to prompt discussions with your managers and team members.

  Also, if you’re interested in exploring these ideas — or in learning more about the design system — join our community and get involved.  

  The first workshop for federal employees will be in Spring 2021, and we hope to hold ad hoc workshops in the future as well. We also hold regular calls on the third Thursday of each month.

  We’ll provide regular updates on our progress in monthly calls, the public Slack channel, and the product roadmap on [designsystem.digital.gov](https://designsystem.digital.gov).
