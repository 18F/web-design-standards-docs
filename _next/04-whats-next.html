title: What’s next
heading: Our future vision
description: |-
  We’ve identified specific opportunity areas that will move us closer to a design system that meets the needs of teams across every agency — what we call our Near Star and North Star vision. Working toward these visions is our way of ensuring the design system continues to change over time and stays connected to the teams that are using it.
