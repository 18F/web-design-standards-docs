heading: Why is this important?
description: |-
  Across the federal government, agencies are working to improve their everyday interactions with the public. How do we provide easy access to critical services? How do we deliver faster and more efficient touch points? How do we ensure transparency and build trust? The answer to these questions has increasingly become: deliver better digital services.

  One piece of the widespread federal effort is implementation of the design system, which provides principles, guidance, and code that makes it easier for the federal government to deliver mobile-friendly, accessible digital services. 

  But we need more. There are still gaps in how the design system can better meet agency needs, so they in turn can better meet the needs of the public. 

  Through this research, we looked to agency teams to help us define what digital transformation looks like, both in the near-term and in the future.
