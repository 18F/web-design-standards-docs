To improve USWDS as a product, we’ll begin refining and implementing the next steps outlined in this report, incorporating additional research and input from the USWDS community as we go. Agencies interested in participating in this process — or simply in learning more about the design system — can join us in our public Slack channel (#uswds-public), for our monthly calls, and in the digital.gov communities of practice.

We also look forward to collaborating with our digital services colleagues in TTS and beyond to explore new ways of providing shared value for government and articulate a more defined path toward our North Star vision of empowered digital teams and trusted experiences.

We thank everyone who shared their time, feedback, and ideas throughout this research effort and invite you — our collaborators and colleagues — to join us in further exploring these big-picture questions by joining our community and attending our events.
