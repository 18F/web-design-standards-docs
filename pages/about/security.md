lead: We have security checks and processes in place to ensure that USWDS is a secure system.
---

We follow GSA's [IT security policy](https://www.gsa.gov/directive/gsa-information-technology-%28it%29-security-policy) to ensure the confidentiality, integrity and availability of USWDS.

We use Snyk to find, fix, and prevent vulnerabilities in USWDS. We run Snyk
checks locally during development and automatically on pull requests kee the USWDS package up-to-date.

We also encourage you to verify the security of the USWDS package you're using:

1. **Check the vulnerability badge.** Confirm the vulnerability badge in the [USWDS Github code repository](https://github.com/uswds/uswds) says there are `0` vulnerabilities.
1. **Download the package via NPM.** We recommend using the [NPM package](/documentation/developers/#install-using-npm) instead of downloading the [zip file](/documentation/developers/#download).  NPM ensures youâ€™re using a legitimate copy of USWDS straight from the source. It also makes it easier to stay
up-to-date with the latest USWDS version.
