The [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) (21st Century IDEA) requires all executive branch agencies to:

- modernize their websites,
- digitize services and forms,
- accelerate use of e-signatures,
- improve customer experience, and
- standardize and transition to centralized shared services.

It also requires agencies to comply with [website standards] (https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/) to improve federal websites and digital services. 

Use the approaches below as a starting point for any solicitations with requirements related to websites and digital services. 

## Before You Get Started

21st Century IDEA codifies high-level requirements for federal websites and digital services.  Additionally, many agencies have more specific requirements in their digital strategy and other guidelines. 

Consult with your agencyâ€™s Chief Information Officer and [Federal Web Council representative] (https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/#current-council-members) regarding agency requirements for websites and digital services, including 21st Century IDEA.

Then work with your contracting officer (CO) to determine your acquisition strategy, including customizing the draft language below to meet your needs and requirements.
