The [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/) (21st Century IDEA) requires all executive branch agencies to:

- modernize their websites,
- digitize services and forms,
- accelerate use of e-signatures,
- improve customer experience, and
- standardize and transition to centralized shared services.

It also requires agencies to comply with [website standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/) to improve federal websites and digital services. 

Use the approaches below as a starting point for any solicitations with requirements related to websites and digital services. 

## Before You Get Started

21st Century IDEA codifies high-level requirements for federal websites and digital services.  Additionally, many agencies have more specific requirements in their digital strategy and other guidelines. 

Consult with your agency’s Chief Information Officer and [Federal Web Council representative](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/#current-council-members) regarding agency requirements for websites and digital services, including 21st Century IDEA.

Then work with your contracting officer (CO) to determine your acquisition strategy, including customizing the draft language below to meet your needs and requirements. 

## Draft Contract Language
**New Solicitations**
In new solicitations, you can include requirements for 21st Century IDEA in the performance work statement. 

> **Draft Language for New Solicitations**
 
> Any website that is developed, modernized, enhanced, maintained, or otherwise delivered as a result of this contract shall be in compliance with the website standards of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services Administration at https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/.
 
> The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) shall be adopted incrementally over the life of the requirement and the contractor shall prioritize implementation to align with the priorities identified within the Performance Work Statement.

**Customize the Draft Language**
Work with your CO to customize the draft language for new and open solicitations. For example, instead of “life of the requirement” you may use period of performance, sprint, next refresh, or another time period. Or, you may replace “Performance Work Statement” with “Statement of Objectives,” agency modernization plans, or another source of priorities.

## Evaluation Factors
You can use evaluation factors to select the best vendor by evaluating their ability to develop modern websites that meet specific requirements in 21st Century IDEA, including incremental adoption of USWDS.
