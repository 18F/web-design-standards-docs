The [21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act](https://digital.gov/resources/21st-century-integrated-digital-experience-act/)
(21st Century IDEA) requires all executive branch agencies to:

- modernize their websites
- digitize services and forms
- accelerate use of e-signatures
- improve customer experience
- standardize and transition to centralized shared services

It also requires agencies to comply with [website standards](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/) to improve federal websites and digital services.

Use the approaches below as a starting point for any solicitations with requirements related to websites and digital services.

## Before you get started

21st Century IDEA codifies high-level requirements for federal websites and digital services. Additionally, many agencies have more specific requirements in their digital strategy and other guidelines.

Consult with your agency’s Chief Information Officer and [Federal Web Council representative](https://digital.gov/resources/federal-web-council/#current-council-members) regarding agency requirements for websites and digital services, including 21st Century IDEA.

Then work with your contracting officer (CO) to determine your acquisition strategy, including customizing the draft language below to meet your needs and requirements.

## Draft contract language

### New solicitations

In new solicitations, you can include requirements for 21st Century IDEA in the performance work statement.

{:.example.border-left-05.border-base-light.padding-left-105.margin-top-2}
> **✎ Draft Language for New Solicitations**
>
> Any website that is developed, modernized, enhanced, maintained, or otherwise delivered as a result of this contract shall be in compliance with the website standards of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services Administration at [https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/).
>
> The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) shall be adopted incrementally over the life of the requirement and the contractor shall prioritize implementation to align with the priorities identified within the Performance Work Statement.

### Open solicitations

You can ask your CO to amend open solicitations to include requirements for 21st Century IDEA.

{:.example.border-left-05.border-base-light.padding-left-105.margin-top-2}
> **✎ Draft Language for Open Solicitations**
>
> This solicitation is hereby amended to include the website standards of the Technology Transformation Services of the General Services Administration [(https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/)](https://designsystem.digital.gov/website-standards/) in accordance with the 21st Century Integrated Digital Experience Act.
>
> The U.S. Web Design System (USWDS) shall be adopted incrementally over the life of the requirement and the contractor shall prioritize implementation to align with the priorities identified within the Performance Work Statement.

### Customize the draft language

Work with your CO to customize the draft language for new and open solicitations. For example, instead of “life of the requirement” you may use period of performance, sprint, next refresh, or another time period. Or, you may replace “Performance Work Statement” with “Statement of Objectives,” agency modernization plans, or another source of priorities.

## Evaluation factors
You can use evaluation factors to select the best vendor by evaluating their ability to develop modern websites that meet specific requirements in 21st Century IDEA, including incremental adoption of USWDS.

 <p>
  The Contractor shall provide a link to a public-facing website or digital service developed as a Minimal Viable Product (MVP) based on the provided information. The information contained within the MVP will be evaluated on the following:
 </p>

 <h4>

 <p>
  The Contractor will also submit a 1-page whitepaper outlining their use of the U.S. Web Design System maturity model to deliver a great digital experience integrating design principles, following user experience guidance, and using USWDS code. The whitepaper shall be specific to the MVP developed and the evaluation of this whitepaper will not be conducted on a pass/fail basis.

## Customize the evaluation factors

Work with your CO to select the best evaluation factor and customize the draft language. For example, instead of “18 months” you may require a shorter or longer time period.

For the evaluation scenario, you can use it as an “all or nothing” factor (meaning, price is the only other factor evaluated by the government), or it could be pared down and used alongside other evaluation factors, such as past performance, experience, and price.

Provide as many user scenarios as needed to describe your requirements. A user scenario is a method for telling a story about a user’s interaction with your product, service, or website, focusing on the what, how, and why. Check out the user scenarios card in 18F Methods for more information on how to write scenarios.

## Accessibility requirements
Accessibility is not only the law, it’s also fundamental to a great digital experience. To ensure your technology is usable by all, regardless of ability, address accessibility and other requirements up-front in all your IT-related contracts and purchases.

You can find sample procurement language in the [Accessibility Requirements Tool](https://www.section508.gov/buy/accessibility-requirements-tool).
