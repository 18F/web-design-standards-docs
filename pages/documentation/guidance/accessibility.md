When it comes to accessibility, legal requirements are a critical, necessary starting point, but this is only the beginning. Accessibility is about real people who use our services — it's usability for people who interact with products differently. Everyone who works on government websites has a role to play in making federal resources accessible and inclusive. Incorporate accessibility from the start, design generously, and celebrate accessibility requirements as a set of design constraints that help us create a better product for all users.

## How USWDS approaches accessibility

By addressing accessibility in the development and maintenance of your agency site, you are enhancing the overall usability. We help with these efforts by baking 508 compliance into the development of every component and by including accessibility as a consideration for all of our guidance. While adopting the U.S. Web Design System will automatically improve accessibility for your site, there are still efforts that need to be conducted manually to improve usability.

## What we do

### During discovery

When designing and developing a new component, the first step we take is to perform user research in the discovery phase. Landscape analyses and other research efforts provide a baseline of common best practices for a particular component. These are weighed according to use cases for the component, which are then referenced for developing hypotheses for user testing. A large part of what is researched is driven by accessibility considerations such as the impact the design will have on screen readers.

### During testing

The component guidance is written to support accessibility as well. After the prototype has been tested by users and run through a 508 compliance check, the findings dictate the implementation suggestions that will enhance the usability of the component once added to your site. Simply integrating a component into your site falls short of the main objective of increasing accessibility – instead, you should closely follow the guidance to make the most of the component. Given the importance of the guidance, we also run user testing on the copy itself to ensure clarity and practicality.

### During iterative improvements

The design system is an ever-evolving product and there are always opportunities for making iterative improvements. The feedback we receive from the community guides future research on enhancements to the accessibility of a component and its guidance. It isn’t until the component has been introduced into the wild that we are able to identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement.

While we conduct extensive research during the design and development of components, it is impossible to predict every use case for accessibility and usability overall. That is why we encourage you to [contribute to the community]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/community) by providing feedback on how a component is working on your site. We also recommend performing your own user testing at the page level to gauge the usability of a component within context. We welcome any and all findings and feedback as we work to identify and prioritize improvements to our components and guidance.

## Key accessibility considerations

- Can users navigate your site using only the keyboard?
- Can users use a screen reader to access the page content?
- Can users quickly understand the main points of your content?
- Can users easily interpret content associated with graphic elements?
- Can users easily understand and complete key tasks?
- Are you testing your service with a broad range of users?
- Do you know your agency accessibility team?
- Is your site organized such that everyone can navigate it easily?
- Are you using accessibility testing tools?
- Did your accessibility testing tools provide accurate results?
- Are you providing content in [languages other than English](https://digital.gov/resources/improving-access-to-services-for-people-with-limited-english-proficiency-e-o-13166/), as appropriate for the audience?

### Practical actions

- **Humanize accessibility.** Seek out examples of the real life impact of accessible products and services. Try to make accessibility less abstract and more personal.
- **Use agency resources.** Reach out to [your agency's accessibility team](https://www.section508.gov/tools/coordinator-listing) and build a relationship with them.
- **Learn about assistive technology.** Get familiar with the basic ways people use assistive technology and [how people with disabilities use the web](https://www.w3.org/WAI/people-use-web/).
- **Follow existing standards.** Conform to the [Revised 508 Standards](https://www.access-board.gov/guidelines-and-standards/communications-and-it/about-the-ict-refresh) and [WCAG 2.0](https://www.w3.org/TR/WCAG20/).
- **Work from existing resources.** Consult [Section508.gov](https://www.section508.gov/), [Accessibility for Teams](https://accessibility.digital.gov/), and the [18F Accessibility Guide](https://accessibility.18f.gov/).
- **Design generously.** Adopt an [inclusive design](http://inclusivedesignprinciples.org/) mentality.
- **Develop accessible code.** Ensure front-end code is written accessibly and conducts manual and automated testing.
- **Write accessible content.** Ensure content is written in [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) and [headings](https://accessibility.18f.gov/headings/), [images](https://accessibility.18f.gov/images/), and [links](https://accessibility.18f.gov/links/) are accurately labeled.
- **Build accessible designs.** Ensure that designs are accessible, pages are laid out in a logical order, and content meets color contrast requirements.
- **Test broadly.** Test with a broad range of users and abilities throughout the design and development process, including manual accessibility testing against the [Trusted Tester and ICT Testing Baseline](https://www.section508.gov/test/trusted-tester).
- **Be responsive.** Remediate accessibility issues when you discover them.
- **Contract for accessibility.** Use the [Accessibility Requirements Tool](https://www.section508.gov/buy/accessibility-requirements-tool) (ART) to incorporate accessibility requirements into your contracts.
