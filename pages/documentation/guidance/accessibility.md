By addressing accessibility in the development and maintenance of your agency site, you are enhancing the overall usability. We help with these efforts by baking 508 compliance into the development of every component and by including accessibility as a consideration for all of our guidance. While adopting the U.S. Web Design System will automatically improve accessibility for your site, there are still efforts that need to be conducted manually to improve usability.

## What we do

### During discovery

When designing and developing a new component, the first step we take is to perform user research in the discovery phase. Landscape analyses and other research efforts provide a baseline of common best practices for a particular component. These are weighed according to use cases for the component, which are then referenced for developing hypotheses for user testing. A large part of what is researched is driven by accessibility considerations such as the impact the design will have on screen readers.

### During testing

The component guidance is written to support accessibility as well. After the prototype has been tested by users and run through a 508 compliance check, the findings dictate the implementation suggestions that will enhance the usability of the component once added to your site. Simply integrating a component into your site falls short of the main objective of increasing accessibility – instead, you should closely follow the guidance to make the most of the component. Given the importance of the guidance, we also run user testing on the copy itself to ensure clarity and practicality.

### During iterative improvements

The design system is an ever-evolving product and there are always opportunities for making iterative improvements. The feedback we receive from the community guides future research on enhancements to the accessibility of a component and its guidance. It isn’t until the component has been introduced into the wild that we are able to identify and prioritize opportunities for improvement.

While we conduct extensive research during the design and development of components, it is impossible to predict every use case for accessibility and usability overall. That is why we encourage you to [contribute to the community]({{ site.baseurl }}/about/community) by providing feedback on how a component is working on your site. We also recommend performing your own user testing at the page level to gauge the usability of a component within context. We welcome any and all findings and feedback as we work to identify and prioritize improvements to our components and guidance.
