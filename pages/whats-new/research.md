lead: User research will be a core aspect of the U.S. Web Design System project as it’s our main source of feedback and inspiration for future product development.
---
We plan to use a combination of research methods, quantitative research like collecting web analytics to see in how frequently the Design System is used around the federal government, and qualitative research like remote and in-person observational studies to see whether the Design System is making government sites easier for people to use.

We’ll use this research to see how well the Design System is working and what needs to be improved. We can also provide user research services to teams that are using the Design System. These will be priced to allow teams around the federal government to engage with us and improve their product for their users. This benefits the Design System as well because we’ll get feedback on where they need to be improved and extended.

## Analytics Reporting

### Quarterly Reports

Once a quarter the metrics displayed on the [about our work]({{ site.baseurl }}/about-our-work/)
page will be updated to reflect the recent traffic and usage of the U.S.
Web Design System. We will use this information to identify future
improvements to the design patterns. You can use these metrics to help justify
the adoption and continued use of the Design System.


#### Dependencies
* Your product team has defined the metrics and funnels you want to track and report
* One of your product team members must be familiar enough with web analytics to set up the tracking and reporting

## User Research Activities
### Recruitment

One of our challenges is knowing who is interested in being part of our user research. To resolve this, we will implement several channels for federal designers and developers to signal their interest and provide their contact information to us. This will allow us to conduct research in a timely fashion.

#### Potential Methods
* Re-activate the screener to intercept users of designsystem.digital.gov
* Provide a “Contact Us” feature on designsystem.digital.gov
* Perform outreach via federal listservs and other digital channels

### Digital Service Team Remote Interviews

One of the most consistent ways we have collected feedback from our users has been by conducting remote interviews with digital service teams around the federal government. This has allowed us to collect direct feedback and suggestions for how to improve the product. Given this success, the team aims to continue using this method on a frequent (1-2 interviews per month) basis.

### Bi-annual Contextual Inquiries

Twice a year, the team will schedule a round of in-person interviews with teams around the federal government to meet with and observe how teams have been using, or would like to be using, the U.S. Web Design System. The information gathered during these “contextual inquires” will ensure that the product is continuously delivering what federal teams and the general public need.

### Open House Events (with Remote Options)

The team will host open house events at the GSA Headquarters in Washington D.C and remotely using web conferencing tools. During these events, the team will conduct training presentations and allow teams using the Design System to showcase their products and explain how they’ve implemented them. These events will be open to anyone in federal government.
