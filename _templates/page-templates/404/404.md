A 404 page tells users that the webpage they’re trying to view no longer exists, has moved, or can’t be found. Using [plain language](https://www.plainlanguage.gov/) on a 404 page to explain the error and provide useful instructions on what the user should do next can help minimize frustration and confusion.

The 404 template has six sections that can be tailored to most types of error pages:

1. Describe the error - main heading
1. What caused the error - lead text
1. Possible ways to fix the error - regular text
1. Actions - buttons or links
1. Additional support channels, if available - list
1. Error code
