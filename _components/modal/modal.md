A modal is unique because it purposefully interrupts a user’s workflow and prevents interaction with the page content underneath unless a user completes the required action or dismisses it. **They should be used sparingly to minimize unnecessary disruptions for the user.**

Modals should have a simple headline that clearly states the purpose. They often have additional text to further explain what the user needs to do or why. Avoid using modals to display complex forms or large amounts of information.
