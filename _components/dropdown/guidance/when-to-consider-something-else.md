- **Fewer than seven options.** Use radio buttons instead.
- **More than 15 options.** If the list of options is very long. Let users type the same information into a text input that suggests possible options instead.
- **Multi-select.** If you need to allow users to select more than one option at once. Users often donâ€™t understand how to select multiple items from dropdowns. Use checkboxes instead.
- **Site navigation.** Use the navigation components instead.
