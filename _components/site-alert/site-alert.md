When your agency has urgent information to share with the public, itâ€™s essential that it stands out from other content on the site. A site alert prominently displays critical, time-sensitive warnings or directions across every page so that users see it whenever they visit the site. Using the same site alert treatment across agencies helps create a consistent and predictable way for users to find urgent information across all government websites.
