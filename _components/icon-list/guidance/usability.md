- **Use consistent headings.** Headings should be written with parallel structure.  For instance, all start with an action verb.  When possible, keep headings short enough to fit on one or two lines.
- **Add rich content sparingly.** Each list item can display rich text content like HTML, images, and even other components. Be succinct. Too much complexity distracts from the impact of an icon list.
- **Use similar icons.** Use the same icon for each list item unless variation is meaningful (e.g., ✔︎ vs. ✗’s).  Icons should come from the same icon library and have a similar look and feel.
