#### When to use the range slider component

{:.usa-content-list}

- **When the range is more important than precision.** For instance, it could be more important for a target price selector to communicate where the target price falls within a certain range than the precise dollar amount selected.
- **When a relative value is more important than an exact value.** For instance, a volume slider is typically more focussed on the relative loudness of the output rather than the specific decibel level.

#### When to consider something else

{:.usa-content-list}

- Use a regular text input if a user needs to enter a precise number.

#### Usability guidance

{:.usa-content-list}

- **Highlight the control when selected.** The slider control should change color to indicate it is active when a user selects it.
- **The control must be draggable.** Users should be able to drag the slider control or select somewhere along the slider itself to change the value.
- **Label the limits of the range.** When appropriate, label the ends of the slider with the limits of the range (for example: "0/100", "small/large" or "less expensive/more expensive").
- **Don’t be too granular.** In a range slider, the relative value is more important than the specific value, so set the `step` attribute so it’s not too granular. By setting the step to a value of 10-20% of the total range you prevent unnecessary precision and cognitive strain in your users. For example, set `step="10"` in a total range of 100.

#### Accessibility

{:.usa-content-list}

- **Customize accessibly.** As you customize this form template, ensure it continues to follow the [accessibility guidelines for form templates]({{ site.baseurl }}/form-templates/) and the [accessibility guidelines for form controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/form-controls/).

#### Implementation

{:.usa-content-list}

- Set the `min` and `max` attribute of the `input` element to correspond to the instructions or labels that accompany the slider.
