A breadcrumb bar (or _breadcrumbs_, or _breadcrumb trail_) is a series of links that describes the hierarchical relationship between the current page and the overall site structure. Breadcrumbs allow a user to navigate “up” instead of using the “Back” button to return to the previous page. A breadcrumb bar facilitates orientation when a user navigates to an interior page from a web search or link from another site.
