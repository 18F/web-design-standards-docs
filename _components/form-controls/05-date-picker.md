    <h4>When to use the date picker component</h4>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li><strong>Scheduling.</strong> When users needs to schedule an event and benefit from the context of a calendar.</li>
      <li><strong>When the day of the week is important.</strong> When knowing the day of the week helps users choose a specific date.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>When to consider something else</h4>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li><strong>Familiar dates.</strong> When asking users for a date they know well, or can look up without using a calendar (like a birthday), use <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/form-controls/#date-input">date input fields</a>.</li>
      <li><strong>When the day of the week is irrelevant.</strong> If there's no benefit to knowing the day of the week for a particular date, consider <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/form-controls/#date-input">date input fields</a>.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4>Usability guidance</h4>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li><strong>Describe the date format.</strong> Provide a hint of <code>mm/dd/yyyy</code> to help users enter the proper date format if they opt not to use the date picker.</li>
    </ul>
    <h4 class="usa-heading">Accessibility</h4>
    <ul class="usa-content-list">
      <li><strong>Customize accessibly.</strong> If you customize the date picker, ensure it continues to meet the the <a href="{{ site.baseurl }}/form-controls/"> accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls.</a></li>
      <li><strong>Avoid auto-submission.</strong> Donâ€™t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.</li>
    </ul>
