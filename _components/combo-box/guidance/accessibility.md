- **Customize accessibly.** If you customize the combo box, ensure it continues to meet the the [accessibility requirements that apply to all form controls]({{ site.baseurl }}/form-controls).
- **Always use a label.**  Make sure your dropdown has a label. Don’t replace it with the default menu option (for example, removing the “State” label and just having the dropdown read “Select a state” by default).
- **Avoid auto-submission.** Don’t use JavaScript to automatically submit the form (or do anything else) when an option is selected. Auto-submission disrupts screen readers because they select each option as they read them.
