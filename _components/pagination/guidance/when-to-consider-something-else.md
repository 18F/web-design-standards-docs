- **Limited number of items.** If the list is fewer than 15 items, display all of the items at once instead of using pagination.

- **Steps in a sequence.** If you need to indicate progress in a series of steps that must be completed in succession, like an onboarding flow, consider using the [step indicator component]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/step-indicator).

- **Infinite scroll on mobile.** For mobile, “Load more” functions may be more suitable to serve up batches of content, organized vertically down the page.
