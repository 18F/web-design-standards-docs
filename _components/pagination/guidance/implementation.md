**Pagination setting.**

- Pagination is meant as a theme for your tech stack’s implementation. We recommend displaying the first, current - 1, current, current + 1, and the last page.

- Use `usa-current` class to highlight the currently active page.

- Add `disabled` and `aria-disabled` disabled attributes when there aren’t any pages before or after to navigate.

- Use a unique aria-label if you have two pagination elements on the same page.
