- **Make the component salient.** Consider placing the component at both the top and the bottom of the page to be visible to the user regardless of where their cursor is.

- **Supplement the siteâ€™s existing search.** Pagination is a tool that can support the search functionality built into your site and only impacts the way in which the search results are displayed. We recommend working with your developer team to make any adjustment to the search features themselves.

- **Optimize page length.** Consider page load and performance when determining the cutoff point for items on each page. We recommend showing 10-15 items per page.

- **Pair with the collection component.** To display related items like articles or events in a compact list, consider using pagination with the [collection component]({{ site.baseurl }}/components/collection), which offers short descriptions and then directs users to the original source.
