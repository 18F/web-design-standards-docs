- **Don’t rely on color.** Site visitors should be able to distinguish links from normal text without relying on color alone. Include an underline or bottom border to clearly convey what text is linked.
- **Use unique, meaningful language.** The text of the link should describe its purpose and help the user understand where the link will take them. Avoid generic link text (e.g., “click here,” “read more,” etc.), which can be confusing and repetitive, especially to screen readers. Also, don’t use the same link text for different URLS on a page.
- **Consider context when indicating external links.** It’s not usually necessary to explain that a link will take users to a page on another site. If it will cause confusion to not indicate a link is external, specify where the link’s taking users within the content itself (e.g., <span class="text-underline">The latest recommendation is to wear two masks [CDC.gov]</span> when going out).

  This method is preferable to using an external link icon, which is often interpreted as share or open in a new tab. We don’t recommend using it, unless it’s your agency’s preferred style.

- **Show file type and size.** Tell users ahead of time if the link will trigger a file download, and show the size and format of that file (e.g., <span class="text-underline">2020 annual report - PDF 1MB [FEMA.gov]</span>).
- **In-page links.** If you’re using anchor links, clearly indicate that these links will scroll the user down on the same page by indicating where the user will go in the link text (e.g., <span class="text-underline">jump to video resources</span>) or including the anchor links under a descriptive title such as “In this article.”\
- **Write out email and phone links.** For `mailto:` and `tel:` links, be sure to write out email addresses and phone numbers so people can read them without having to click on them first (don’t hyperlink someone’s name with an email address or use the link text “email here”). Not all browsers will automatically display a clickable link when they detect an email address or phone number, so encode a link just in case. Include the country code in phone numbers in case the site visitor is international.

  Note: While displaying email addresses and phone numbers provides a better experience for users, it can increase things like spam for the recipient. **Check with your IT security department on best practices for your agency.**

  Here are some ways that could help mitigate the risk:

  - Use group emails so a specific individual’s email address isn’t compromised. This also means the email address can remain the same even as staff and organizational structures change.
  - Provide a contact form instead of showing email addresses when possible, to protect email addresses from harvesters and spam.

- **Use deep links.** Send the user directly to the most topically relevant page instead of linking to a homepage or landing page and expecting them to find subpages.
