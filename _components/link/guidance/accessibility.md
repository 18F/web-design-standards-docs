- **Allow keyboard navigation of links.** Users should be able to navigate between links by using the “Tab” key. They should also be able to activate a link when pressing ‘Enter’ on their keyboard. Users should be able to activate hover and focus states with both a mouse and a keyboard.
- **Set focus state on link target.** When using smooth scrolling for in-page anchor links, make sure to set the focus state on the link target. Many third-party scripts fail to consider this behavior.
