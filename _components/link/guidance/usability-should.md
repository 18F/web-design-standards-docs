- **Include the destination for all external links.** Include the domain of the destination in the link text of all external links, even if the destination is another federal website. Use all-lowercase in the domain name for consistency. Any of the following approaches ensures the destination is read by screen readers and alerts the user they will leave your site if they follow the link. This usability practice reduces confusion and increases trust across federal websites.

    **Example 1:** Include the destination in the copy introducing the link.
    > [CDC recommends using sunscreen when you’re outside](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/sun-safety.htm) to reduce your risk of skin damage and skin cancer.

    **Example 2:** Append the destination after the link in square brackets.
    > Public health experts recommend that you [use sunscreen when you’re outside [cdc.gov]](https://www.cdc.gov/cancer/skin/basic_info/sun-safety.htm).

    **Example 3:** Use the same approach for non-government links.
    > To ensure food safety during an emergency, [do not open the refrigerator or freezer [redcross.org]](https://www.redcross.org/get-help/how-to-prepare-for-emergencies/types-of-emergencies/food-safety.html).

- **Use unique, meaningful language.** The text of the link should describe its purpose and help the user understand where the link will take them.

- **Show file type and size.** Tell users ahead of time if the link will trigger a file download and show the size and format of that file in brackets. Use uppercase for consistency. We recommend using the file type rather than a product name.

    **Example 1:**
    > GSA published a report, [Transforming the American Digital Experience [PDF; 1.2 MB]](https://designsystem.digital.gov/files/next/Transforming-the-American-digital-experience.pdf)

    **Example 2:**
    > Download the [Revised 508 Standards Applicability Checklist [section508.gov; DOCX; 28 KB]](https://section508.gov/sites/default/files/Revised%20508%20Standards%20Applicability%20Checklist%20%287%29.docx)

- **Identify in-page links.** Clearly identify inline anchor links, which jump the user down on the same page, by indicating in the link text where the user will go.

    **Example:**
    > [Jump to video resources](javascript:void(0)) for more information about how to boil water.

- **Summarize in-page links on long pages.** Add a list of all anchor links on that page to break out the sections for the user to see at a glance. A list at the top of the page or in a sidebar/side-nav are two common places to display this list.

- **Use direct links.** Send the user directly to the most topically relevant page instead of linking to a homepage or landing page and expecting users to find subpages.

- **Write out email and phone links.** For `mailto:` and `tel:` links, write out email addresses and phone numbers so users can read this information without having to commit to clicking.

    **Example:**
    > Email us at [uswds@support.digitalgov.gov](mailto:uswds@support.digitalgov.gov)

- **Check with your IT security department regarding email link best practices.** While displaying email addresses and phone numbers provides a better experience for users, it can increase spam for the email recipient. One approach is to use a group email to protect individuals. The email address will remain the same even as staff and organizational structures change. Also consider using a contact form instead of showing email addresses.

- **Encode email and phone links.** Some browsers don’t automatically display a clickable link for email addresses or phone numbers, so encode email and phone links with `mailto:` and `tel:`. Include the country code in phone numbers to support international users.
