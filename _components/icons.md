USWDS uses a curated set of [Material Design](https://material.io/resources/icons/?style=baseline) icons on the project as an SVG sprite. They are available for use in `src/img/usa-icons`. Any icons not included in the curated set are located in `src/img/usa-icons-unused`. You can move them into your project and rebuild the SVG sprite using the [USWDS Gulpfile](http://github.com/uswds/uswds-gulp/).

### When to use icons

{:.usa-content-list}

- **Create affordance.** Icons are helpful when combined with text to inform users about performing an action.
- **Help readers find key info.** Use icons as easy-to-understand, translation-free visual indicators for key information like phone number or email.
- **Clickable symbol.** Icons make great touch targets. Use an icon for actions like opening a menu or sharing an article. This is especially beneficial on a mobile device where icons take up more percentage of the screen.

### When to consider something else

{:.usa-content-list}

- **You need a graphic illustration or artwork.** Icons and illustrations look different and serve different purposes.
  - Icons visually represent a simple idea, object or activity at-a-glance. Icons are composed of simple shapes and must be easily recognizable at small and large sizes. Icons invite action by the user and can be used as interactive elements.
  - Illustrations are more complex than icons. They tell a story and point to the main idea of a larger set of content, usually paragraphs of text. Illustrations are unrecognizable below a certain size because of the complexity of shapes and concept. Illustrations are rarely used as interactive elements on their own.
- **Text is sufficient.** Icons lose their value when used unnecessarily or their meaning is unclear.
- **Drawing attention to hard-to-find actions.** For actions, placement on the page has more impact than decoration. So if youâ€™re trying to draw users attention to something by jazzing it up with an icon, instead, try adjusting where it sits on the page, creating consistent patterns for user flow.

### Usability guidance

{:.usa-content-list}

- **Be consistent with icon meaning.** Images that are used a number of times throughout an application (e.g., icons on navigation controls) must have a consistent meaning and text description throughout the application. For example, if an icon of a blank piece of paper means "new document" on most screens, the same icon cannot be used elsewhere to mean "reformat document". Consistency aids users with cognitive disabilities.
- **Combine with text.** Users will not always understand the meaning of icons alone. Using icons combined with text improves usability.

### Accessibility

{:.usa-content-list}

- Hide the icon with `aria-hidden="true"` if the icon is decorative.
- Provide descriptive text when an icon is meaningful or has an action associated with it. 
- Avoid redundant links with icons positioned next to linked text. Screen readers will read both links separately, even though both links point to the same content. This is a poor user experience.

### Implementation

{:.usa-content-list}

- Icons use `currentColor`, so the color of the icon will be the color of your text. You can use the [color utility]({{ site.baseurl }}/utilities/color/) to change the color.
- You might need to change the path of sprite of the sprite based on the needs of your project.
