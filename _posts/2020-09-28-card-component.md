# Introducing the USWDS card component
## What it is and when to use it
This May, in USWDS 2.7.0, we released a [card component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/card/), which is a design element that visually groups information together into a container. The card component is one of our most requested features, as well as one of the most common components in other design systems. Our [landscape analysis](https://github.com/uswds/uswds/wiki/Card-Landscape-Analysis) of other design systems and government websites — including cards in the [U.S. Patent & Trademark Office Design Library](https://uspto.github.io/designpatterns/1.x/docs/patterns/cards.html) and [Small Business Association Design System](https://ussba.github.io/certify-design-system-documentation/patterns/card-patterns.html) — confirmed that this component was both useful and important for USWDS.

## What the card component looks like
Like most things we design, a card should be easily scannable to determine the topic and the action. Both visual and content hierarchy are important. The basic card anatomy can contain a variety of content types, such as text, images and multimedia, or even buttons and links. Because a card is **modular**, it should be able to stand alone without relying on surrounding elements for context.

Card components could include any of the following elements:
1. **Container:** Card containers hold all card elements, and their size is determined by the space those elements occupy. Card elevation is expressed by the container.
2. **Media:** Cards can include a variety of media, including photos, graphics or icons. 
3. **Header:** Header text should provide the subject for the card. Users will scan for this first.
4. **Body:** The main portion of the card should include a summary or description providing a lead into the call-to-action (button) for more detailed information.
5. **Footer:** A footer can include buttons or links for actions.

## When to use the card component
The best use for a card is when you know users are going to be browsing for information on the page, rather than using search. However, keep in mind that cards are less scannable than other forms of chunking of content, such as a regular list view. You might also consider cards when you are grouping together different types of content across multiple cards. This will give a standardized look and feel to otherwise heterogenous items. Additionally, there are advantages to using cards on mobile, such as the large clickable space and the neat stacking functionality.
 
Cards can also be displayed as a collection and serve as lists or be used in a dashboard, for example. The collection of cards allows for another level of content strategy. You can vary the order, and thereby the hierarchy, of cards in a collection without destroying any individual card’s meaning.

## Contribute to the USWDS card component
The [card component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/card/) is the first component we released in 2020. We have a list of other new components on our [2020 roadmap](https://designsystem.digital.gov/about/product-roadmap/). We recently released the [breadcrumb component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/breadcrumb/) as well. We’d love for you to share your thoughts and experiences with the card.
