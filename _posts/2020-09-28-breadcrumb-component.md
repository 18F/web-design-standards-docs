# USWDS 2.8.0 includes breadcrumb component 
## When and how to use it
This July, in USWDS 2.8.0, we released a [breadcrumb component](https://designsystem.digital.gov/components/breadcrumb/), which is a secondary navigational element to help users understand where they are in a website. A breadcrumb bar (or breadcrumbs, or breadcrumb trail) is a series of links that describes the hierarchical relationship between the current page and the overall site structure. 
Our landscape analysis of other design systems and government websites, along with user testing, led us to initial recommendations of how the breadcrumb component should look and when it should be used. For example, we were able to determine guidance around:
The difference between the browser's Back button and breadcrumbs
- When to use breadcrumbs while other navigation aids are present
- How to truncate long content
- The importance of having well-structured content within a content management system

These findings helped us determine the appropriate times to use the breadcrumb component and the best way to incorporate it into sites.
